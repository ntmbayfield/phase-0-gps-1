I was struggling with the concept of how to actually push and/or pull files from the repository on GitHub.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The concept of how to actually merge a file was clarified during this session.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I completed this exercise on my own, so I didn't ask any questions of my pair or the guide.

What still confuses you about Git?
I'm still confused about how to create a merge conflict as I was unable to replicate making one.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I didn't get to do this exercise as part of a pair, so I'm still looking forward to my first GPS pairing.  But I would have appreciated having someone to talk to and get feedback from, as I was going through the steps in the the Git Workflow.
